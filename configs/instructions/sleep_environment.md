Make sure your sleep environment stays consistent with what you're used to - it helps your body relax and settle in.

Keep your laptop nearby, place it on a flat, stable surface (like a nightstand or bedside table) **within arm’s reach** for easy access.

Here are some tips for a good sleep setup:

- Dim or turn off the lights.

- Keep your room **cool** (ideally **16-19°C / 60-67°F**).

- Use **blackout curtains** or an **eye mask** to block out light.

- Sleep on a **comfortable mattress and supportive pillows**.

- Keep your bed fresh—**change sheets regularly** and **air out the room**.

- Avoid **blue light** from screens before bed (phones, tablets, TVs).

- Keep distractions away—no work materials, bright clocks, or unnecessary gadgets.
