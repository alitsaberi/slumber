If you encounter any issues:

- Replug the dongle.

- Check the battery level of the EEG headband.

- Ensure the EEG headband is turned on.

- Ensure the patch is properly attached to your skin.

- Rewear the EEG headband.

- **Avoid closing or restarting the software**. If you do so accidentally, you will need to restart the guide from the beginning.

- If none of the above resolves the issue, end the current experimental session and contact us to report the problem in the morning.
