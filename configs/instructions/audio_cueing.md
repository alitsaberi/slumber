During the experiment, you may receive auditory cues as **semantic audio** played from the laptop speakers.

- If you do, respond by repeating the **LRLR eye movement**.

For the next step, You will assess whether you can perceive the audio while keeping your eyes closed in a resting wakefulness state.

**Next step: Audio calibration test.**
- Place the laptop within reach, at most an armâ€™s length away from you.

- Click the **"Present Cue"** button. A countdown will appear.

- After the countdown ends, click the **"Yes/No"** button to indicate whether you perceived the audio cue.

- Repeat this process until a confirmation message appears and the **"Done"** button is activated.

- If you have repeated the tasks for >20 times and a confirmation message still does not appear, end the current experimental session and contact us to report this issue in the morning.
