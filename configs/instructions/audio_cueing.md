During the experiment, you may receive auditory cues as **semantic audio** played from the laptop speakers. These cues are designed to be effective yet unobtrusive, so it is important to adjust their volume accordingly.  

Initially, the audio cue volume is set to its minimum. In the next task, you will assess whether you can perceive the sound while remaining in a resting wakefulness state with your eyes closed.  

- If you **do not** perceive the sound, increase the volume by one step and try again.  
- Continue this process until you can **clearly perceive** the sound while keeping your eyes closed.
