### How to wear the EEG headband

Hold the EEG headband with the larger LED lights facing downward.

Gently press the gels (i.e., the sticky parts) onto the skin. Ensure they are in full contact.

- For the forehead:
  - Find the **flattest area** of your forehead, usually near the center and close to your eyebrows.
  - Attach the middle gels to your forehead.

- For the temples:
  - Attach the side gels to your temples.
  - Ensure they are slightly higher than the middle gels, rather than perfectly horizontal.

Fasten the Velcro strap **slightly lower than the bump at the back of your head**.
