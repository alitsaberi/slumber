* How to attach the patch to the headband

1. position ZMax on a flat portion of your forehead, towards your eyebrows
2. the lower central electrode should not 'stick out' (if this conflicts with #1, you can cut off a part of it)
3. the headband must cover the lateral sensing areas
4. the headband must not be too loose.
5. the headband must be tightened at the back of the head just below the inion bone (not completely parallel to the ground but tilted downwards at an angle)
6. there must be no hair underneath the lateral sensing areas (use female/children size electrode, and you can cut out a portion of the lateral sensing areas)
7. make sure the metallic snaps are inserted properly. You should hear 4 clicks, and no clicks when wearing the device.
8. push on the headband, sensing surfaces and device after wearing, make sure the headband is sufficiently tight to withstand night-time movements.
