You will need to complete two questionnaires whenever you wake up.

The first questionnaire contains open questions that you can answer with voice recording.

For the next step, you will record your voice and test the voice recording function.

**Next step: Voice recording test**

- Click the **"Start recording"** button.

- Read the text provided at a normal volume.

- Click the **"Stop recording"** button.

- Play the recording. If you cannot hear it, try recording again.

- If the issue persists, you can either continue without the voice recording function and manually type your answers for the open questions, or refer to "If you encounter any issues" in the "? Help" section.
