During the cognitive training, you will focus on your sensations and be presented with sensory cues. The instructions will be delivered through a pre-recorded English audio track. The training lasts about 30 minutes. Occasionally, you may receive a short version of the cognitive training during awakenings.

The cognitive training task occurs as the final task in the procedure. After the training ends, you may go to sleep without needing to look at the screen or interact with the software. The procedure will automatically finish, and the sleep page state will change to **Asleep**.

## Steps to complete the cognitive training task

1. **Prepare for sleep**

    - Ensure you are ready to go to sleep before starting the training.

2. **Start the training**

    - Click the **Start** button to begin the training session.

    - A timer will appear, allowing you time to settle in bed before the training starts.

    - Once the timer ends, the cognitive training will commence.

4. **Follow the audio instructions**

    - Pay close attention to the audio instructions and follow them carefully.

5. **Go to sleep**

    - After the training ends, you may go to sleep without further action.
