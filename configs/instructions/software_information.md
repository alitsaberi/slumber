During the session, you may need to complete a series of tasks.

These tasks can be as simple as reading instructions or filling out questionnaires. You can see an overview of the tasks in the column on the **right side** of the screen.

Below this column, there are buttons to navigate between tasks:

- **Next**: Click this button to proceed to the next task. It is only enabled once you have completed the current task. For example, for instruction tasks like this one, you need to manually click the **"Done"** button at the end of the instructions.

- **Previous**: Click this button to go back to previously completed tasks in the procedure.

- **Done**: This button is enabled only when all tasks in the procedure are completed. Once you click it, you will no longer be able to return to previous tasks, and you will proceed to the next step.

On the upper right corner, you will see a **"? Help"** button that will navigate you to the help menu. You can refer to the help menu when you have questions or encounter issues during the session. Sometimes you are referred to the help menu in the instructions.
