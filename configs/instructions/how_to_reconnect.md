If you encounter any issues during the session, try if one of the solutions below can solve the issues:

1. Make sure the EEG headband receiver is properly connected.

   - Try to reconnet by replugging the dongle. Consult the **help menu** for how to properlly connect the EEG headband receiver.

2. Make sure the EEG headband is on.

   - If it is not on, turn it on. Consult the **help menu** for the light indicators for the EEG headband status and how to turn on/off the EEG headband.

   - Reset the EEG headband by poking the little hole with a sharp object (e.g., needle, tooth pick, etc.) at the bottom of the back side of the EEG headband. Consul the **help menu** for details on how to reset the EEG headband.

3. Check the battery level of the EEG headband.

   - If the little LED light is off, it indicates that the battery is dead. Please charge the EEG headand. It should take approximately 1 hour to charge from 0% to 100%. 

   - Verify the battery is at a healthy level by checking the LED light:  

     - If the headband is **OFF**, the LED should blink **slowly in blue**.  
   
     - If the headband is **ON**, the LED should remain **solid blue** (no blinking).

4. Ensure the patch is properlly attached to your skin.

   - The gels should not be floating (there should be no space between the gels and your skin). 

   - Consult the **help menu** for how to properlly wear the EEG headband.

5. If none of the above resolves the issue.
