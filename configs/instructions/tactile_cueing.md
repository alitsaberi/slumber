The next step is a task assessing whether you can perceive **tactile cues**.

**Tactile cues** are vibration delivered to your forehead by the EEG headband.

During the session, you may receive **tactile cues**. If you do, respond as described below:

- Repeat the **LRLR eye movement** if you perceive vibration while sleeping or while performing cognitive training.

- **Wake up** if you perceive a **high-intensity** vibration during sleep.

For the next step, first, you will see a **"Present Cue"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below to complete the connection process.

1. Lie down on where you want to sleep.

2. Click the **"Present Cue"** button to indicate you are ready to receive the tactile cue. A countdown will appear.

   - After the countdown, an tactile cue will be delivered. 

3. Respond to the question that appears on the screen.

4. Repeat this process until a **confirmation message** appears and then you can proceed to the next task.

   - The **confirmation message** may appear on the first attempt.  

**Two other possible outcomes** may appear:  

1. **Failed to deliver** the tactile cue.

   - There might be an issue connecting to the headband. Consult the **help menu** to reconnect and reset the EEG headband.

2. The **confirmation message does not appear**.

   - If you have repeated the tasks for >20 times and a confirmation message still does not appear, end the current experimental session and contact us to report this issue in the morning.
