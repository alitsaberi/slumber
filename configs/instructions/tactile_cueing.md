**Tactile cues** are vibrations delivered to your forehead by the EEG headband.

During the session, you may receive **tactile cues** during sleep or cognitive training. This is also used to wake you up if you perceive a **high-intensity** vibration during sleep.

The next step is a task assessing whether you can perceive **tactile cues**. You will see a **"Present Cue"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below:

1. Click the **"Present Cue"** button to indicate you are ready to receive the tactile cue. 

     - A countdown will appear.
     
     - After the countdown, a tactile cue will be delivered.

2. Respond to the question that appears on the screen.

3. The **confirmation message** should appear on the first attempt and then you can proceed to the next task.

     - If it does not appear, try to repeat the process again.

### Two Other Possible Outcomes:

1. **Failed to deliver** the tactile cue.
     
     - There might be an issue connecting to the headband. Consult the **help menu** for instructions on checking the connectivity of the EEG headband.

2. The **confirmation message does not appear** after repeating the tasks more than 10 times.

    - End the current experimental session.
