During the experiment, you may receive light cues through the EEG headband. These cues are designed to be effective yet comfortable, so it is important to adjust their intensity accordingly.  

Initially, the light cue intensity is set to its minimum. In the next task, you will assess whether you can perceive the light while keeping your eyes closed in a resting wakefulness state.  

- If you **do not** perceive the light, increase the intensity by one step and try again.  
- Continue this process until you can **clearly perceive** the light while keeping your eyes closed.
