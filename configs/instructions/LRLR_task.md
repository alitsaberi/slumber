The next step is a demo task for you to practice the **LRLR eye movement**.

First, you will see a **"Start"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below to perform the **LRLR eye movement**. 

1. Remain your head as steady as possible for **10 seconds**.

2. Click the **“Start”** button to indicate you are ready to perform the eye movement.

3. Perform the **LRLR eye movement** with **eyes closed** and relaxe while maintaining steadiness.

4. Click the **“End”** button.

### Three Possible Outcomes:  

1. **LRLR eye movement** successfully recorded.

    - You will see a **connection confirmation message**. 
   
    - You can proceed to the next task.  

2. **Failed to detect** eye movements.

    - You might have performed the eye movement in a wrong way. Try repeating the task.

    - Here are some advice for performing the eye movement:

        - Keep your eyes relaxed and follow the LRLR movement pattern clearly.

        - Perform the movement deliberately but without strain to ensure accurate detection.

        - If you are having trouble staying steady while sitting, try lying down instead.

    - If the issue persists after three attempts: 
   
        - **Check your EEG headband placement** – It may not be worn correctly.

        - **Check the patch is properly attached** – It may not be attached correctly.

        - End the session and contact us in the morning: luciddreamingathome@donders.ru.nl

4. **Failed to collect** data.

    - **Verify the headband connection** – There may be a connectivity issue. Consult the **help menu** for more information.
