The next step is a demo task for you to practice the **LRLR eye movement**.

First, you will see a **"Start"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below to perform the **LRLR eye movement**. 

1. Remain your head as steady as possible for **10 seconds**.

2. Click the **“Start”** button to indicate you are ready to perform the eye movement.

3. Perform the **LRLR eye movement** with eyes closed and relaxed while maintaining steadiness.

4. Click the **“End”** button.

Once you clicked the **"End"** button, there are **three possible outcomes**:  

1. **LRLR eye movement** successfully recorded.

   - You will see a **connection confirmation message**. 
   
   - You can proceed to the next task.  

2. **Failed to detect** eye movements.

   - You might have performed the eye movement in a wrong way. Try repeating the task.

   - Here are some advice for performing the eye movement:

      - Keep your eyes relaxed and follow the LRLR movement pattern clearly.

      - Perform the movement deliberately but without strain to ensure accurate detection.

      - If you’re having trouble staying steady while sitting, try lying down instead.

   - If the issue persists after three attempts: 
   
      - **Check your EEG headband placement** – It may not be worn correctly. Refer to the **help menu** for proper fitting instructions.  

4. **Failed to collect** data.

   - **Verify the headband connection** – There may be a connectivity issue. Check the **help menu** for steps to reconnect and reset the EEG headband.
