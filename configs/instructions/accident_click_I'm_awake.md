Clicking the **"I'm Awake"** button will automatically direct you to questionnaires.  

If you need to **use the bathroom or drink water**, you can do so **before clicking**.  

However, if you accidentally click the **"I'm Awake"** button before Youâ€™re Ready: 

1. In the **first question** of the questionnaire, select the **third answer** (starting with "No") to skip to the end.

2. Click **"Going to Sleep"** to return to the previous state.  

3. Once you are ready, click **"I'm Awake"** to proceed.
