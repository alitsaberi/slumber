By clicking the 'I'm Awake' button, you will be automatically directed to the questionnaires. Therefore, if you need to use the bathroom or drink water, do so before clicking the 'I'm Awake' button.

If you accidentally clicked 'I'm Awake' but are not ready to complete the questionnaires:

- In Question 1, select the answer that starts with "No" to skip to the end of the questionnaire.

- Repeat the steps by clicking "Going to Sleep", complete what you need to do, and then click "I'm Awake" when you are ready."
