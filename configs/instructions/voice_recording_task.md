During the session, you may be asked to answer some questions, including open-ended ones. 

For your convenience, you can respond either by typing your answer or recording your voice â€” you can choose whichever option you prefer.

The next step is a demo task for you to practice the voice recording function.

Follow the steps below to record your voice and test whether it is captured correctly:

1. Click the **"Start recording"** button to indicate you are ready to read the text.

2. Read the text provided at a normal volume.

3. Click the **"Stop recording"** button.

4. Play the recorded voice and check if it was captured correctly and is audible. If not, repeat the process.

5. If the issue continues, here are some options to move forward:

   - Continue without voice recording and simply type your answers for open-ended questions.

   - End the current experimental session and contact us to report this issue in the morning.
