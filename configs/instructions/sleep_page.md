In the page contents, you will see:
 
1. Your current status.

    - **Asleep:** Indicates that you are either asleep or attempting to sleep.

2. A button to change your state.

    - **Going to Sleep:** Click this when you are attempting to fall asleep.

    - **I'm Awake:** Click this if you wake up, either by the software or on your own, or if you fail to fall asleep after trying. If you need to go to the bathroom or drink water, you can do so before clicking.

    - When changing your state, you will be asked to confirm your selection.  

    - If switching to **Awake**, you may need to complete certain tasks.
