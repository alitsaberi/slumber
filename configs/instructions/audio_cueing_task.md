The next step is a task assessing whether you can perceive **audiotory cues**.

**Auditory cues** are semantic audio played from the laptop speakers.

During the session, you may receive **auditory cues** while sleeping or while performing cognitive training.

- If you do, respond by repeating the **LRLR eye movement**.

For the next step, first, you will see a **"Present Cue"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below to complete the connection process.

1. Ensure that the laptop is placed properly. Consult the **help menu** for more details on how to place the laptop.

2. Lie down on where you want to sleep.

3. Click the **"Present Cue"** button to indicate you are ready to receive the auditory cue. A countdown will appear.

   - After the countdown, an auditory cue will be delivered. 

4. Respond to the question that appears on the screen.

5. Repeat this process until a **confirmation message** appears and then you can proceed to the next task.

**Two other possible outcomes** may appear:  

1. **Failed to deliver** the auditory cue.

- There might be an issue connecting to the headband. Consult the **help menu** to reconnect and reset the EEG headband.

2. The **confirmation message does not appear**.

- If you have repeated the tasks for >20 times and a confirmation message still does not appear, end the current experimental session and contact us to report this issue in the morning.
