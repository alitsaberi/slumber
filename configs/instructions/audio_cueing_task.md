**Auditory cues** are semantic audio played from the laptop speakers.

During the session, you may receive **auditory cues** while sleeping or while performing cognitive training.

The next step is a task assessing whether you can perceive **auditory cues**. You will see a **"Present Cue"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that the laptop is placed properly.

2. Click the **"Present Cue"** button to indicate you are ready to receive the auditory cue. A countdown will appear.

    - After the countdown, an auditory cue will be delivered.
    - Before the countdown ends, lie down in your sleep place and keep your eyes closed.

3. Respond to the question that appears on the screen.

4. Repeat this process until a **confirmation message** appears, and then you can proceed to the next task.

### Two Other Possible Outcomes:

1. **Failed to deliver** the auditory cue.

2. The **confirmation message does not appear** after repeating the tasks more than 20 times.

- If you encounter either of the above issues, follow these steps:

    - End the current experimental session.
