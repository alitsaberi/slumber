Before putting on the EEG headband, you will need to clean the patch to make sure the gels stay sticky.

1. Temporarily remove the plastic film and set it aside. 

    - Please do not throw the plastic film away - at the end of each experimental session, you will need to place it back onto the gels to help maintain their stickiness.

2. Gently wipe the gels with the provided **alcohol pads** and let them dry.

    - **Avoid using dry tissues or cloths** - they can leave behind lint or residue, making the gels less sticky.

Each patch typically lasts for about 3 uses. However, if you notice any of the gels losing their stickiness, we kindly ask you replace the patch with a new one to ensure optimal data quality.

- Consult the **help menu** for how to change the patch.
