When you become lucid in dreams, as you can feel free to explore or observe the dream scene as you wish, please also complete the following steps:

1. Perform the **LRLR eye movement** to signal the start of lucidity.

2. If you **notice any sensory cues** after lucidity begins, such as light, sound, or vibration, respond by repeating the LRLR eye movement.

3. If no cues appear after lucidity begins, continue performing the **LRLR eye movement** approximately **every 30 seconds** to sustain lucidity.

In addition, during sleep, whenever you are uncertain whether you are awake or dreaming, perform a **reality check** to verify your state.

- Reality checks are simple tests you can perform in a dream to determine whether you’re actually dreaming or awake.

- You can try one of these reality checks:
   
   - **Pinch your nose and try to breathe** – If you can still breathe, you’re dreaming.

   - **Breathe underwater** – If you can, you’re in a dream.

   - **Poke a finger of one hand through the palm of the other hand** – In a dream, your finger may pass through.  

   - **Check a clock** – If the time appears blurry or changes randomly, you’re in a dream.  

   - **Read text** – If words on a book, magazine, or phone screen keep changing unpredictably, you’re dreaming.
