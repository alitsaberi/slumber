Please complete the following preparations before starting the session:

1. Prepare your sleep environment.
   
    - Make sure your sleep environment stays consistent with what you're used to - it helps your body relax and settle in.
   
    - Consult the **help menu** for some tips for a good sleep setup.

2. Clean your forehead.

    - Gently wash your forehead and temples with mild soap and water to clear away any dirt and dead skin.

    - Pat dry with a soft cloth or tissue to make sure your skin is completely dry.

    - **Avoid using alcohol** - it can be too harsh on your skin.

3. Clean the EEG headband if you have used it before.

    - Before putting on the EEG headband, you will need to clean the patch to make sure the gels stay sticky.
   
    - Temporarily remove the plastic film and set it aside - at the end of each experimental session, you will need to place it back onto the gels to help maintain their stickiness.

    - Gently Wipe the gels with the provided **alcohol pads** and let them dry.

    - **Avoid using dry tissues or cloths** - they can leave behind lint or residue, making the gels less sticky.

    - Each patch typically lasts for about 5 to 6 uses. However, if you notice any of the gels losing their stickiness, we kindly ask you replace the patch with a new one to ensure optimal data quality.

    - Consult the **help menu** for how to change the patch.

4. Laptop placement

    - Keep your laptop nearby.
   
    - Place it on a flat, stable surface (like a nightstand or bedside table) **within armâ€™s reach** for easy access.
