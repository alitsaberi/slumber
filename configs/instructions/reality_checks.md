During sleep, whenever you are uncertain whether you are awake or dreaming, perform a **reality check** to verify your state.

- Reality checks are simple tests you can perform in a dream to determine whether you’re actually dreaming or awake.

- You can try one of these reality checks:
   
    - **Pinch your nose and try to breathe** – If you can still breathe, you’re dreaming.

    - **Breathe underwater** – If you can, you’re in a dream.

    - **Poke a finger of one hand through the palm of the other hand** – In a dream, your finger may pass through.  

    - **Check a clock** – If the time appears blurry or changes randomly, you’re in a dream.  

    - **Read text** – If words on a book, magazine, or phone screen keep changing unpredictably, you’re dreaming.
