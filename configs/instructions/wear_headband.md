### To wear the headband, follow these steps

- Hold it with the two large LED lights facing downward and the patch facing toward you.

- The patch has four light-yellow gels (the sticky parts): two in the middle and two on the sides. Gently press the gels onto the skin as described below and ensure they are in full contact:

#### a) For the Forehead

- Find the **flattest area** of your forehead, usually near the center and close to your eyebrows.

- Attach the middle gels to your forehead.

#### b) For the Temples

- Attach the side gels to your temples.

- Ensure they are slightly higher than the middle gels, rather than perfectly horizontal.

- Make sure you don't have **hair on your temples or forehead that prevents full contact** between the gels and your skin.

### Fasten the Headband

- Fasten the Velcro strap **slightly lower than the bump at the back of your head** to ensure it does not slide down and become loose at night.

- You should feel slight pressure against your head to withstand night-time movements â€” a bit too tight is better than too loose.

- The patch should not stick out from the headband. If it does, adjust it upward or downward until it is fully covered.
