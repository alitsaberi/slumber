1. Position the EEG headband.
   
   - Hold it with the two large LED lights facing downward and the patch facing toward you.

2. Attach the patch.

   - The patch has four light-yellow gels (the sticky parts): two in the middle and two on the sides.

   - Gently press the gels onto the skin as described below and ensure they are in full contact:

   a) For the forehead:

   - Find the **flattest area** of your forehead, usually near the center and close to your eyebrows.

   - Attach the middle gels to your forehead.

   b) For the temples:

   - Attach the side gels to your temples.
  
   - Ensure they are slightly higher than the middle gels, rather than perfectly horizontal.

   - If you have **hair on your temples or forehead that prevents full contact** between the gels and your skin, please refer to the **help menu** for guidance.

3. Apply the headband.

   - Fasten the Velcro strap **slightly lower than the bump at the back of your head** to make sure it does not slide down and become loose at night.

   - You should feel slight pressure against your head to withstand night-time movements â€” a bit too tight is better than too loose.

   - The patch should not stick out from the headband. If they do, adjust them upward or downward until it is fully covered.
