The next step is a task assessing whether you can perceive **light cues** while keeping your eyes closed in a resting wakefulness state.

**Light cues** are red lights coming from the large LED lights of the EEG headband.

During the session, you may receive **light cues** while sleeping or while performing cognitive training.

- If you do, respond by repeating the **LRLR eye movement**.

For the next step, first, you will see a **"Present Cue"** button on the screen. Follow the steps below to complete the connection process.

1. Ensure that the lighting conditions in your sleep environment match those present when you are asleep.

2. Click the **"Present Cue"** button to indicate you are ready to receive the light cue. A countdown will appear.

3. Close your eyes before the countdown ends and wait for 5 seconds.

    - After the countdown, a light cue will be delivered. Keep your eyes closed during this process.

4. Open your eyes and respond to the question that appears on the screen.

5. Repeat this process until a **confirmation message** appears and then you can proceed to the next task.

**Two other possible outcomes** may appear:  

1. **Failed to deliver** the light cue.

    - There might be an issue connecting to the headband. Consult the **help menu** to reconnect and reset the EEG headband.

2. The **confirmation message does not appear**.

    - If you have repeated the tasks for >20 times and a confirmation message still does not appear, end the current experimental session and contact us to report this issue in the morning.
