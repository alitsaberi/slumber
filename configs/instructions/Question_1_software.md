In this guide, there will be text-based instructions and interactive instructions: 

- **Text-based instructions** consist only of text. Simply read the content, then click the **"Done"** button followed by the **"Next"** button to proceed.

- **Interactive instructions** require you to interact with the software. Complete the task to activate the **"Done"** button (i.e., it will turn green), allowing you to continue.

The **“Next”** button will only appear (i.e., turn green) after you click the **“Done”** button.

- When the **“Next”** button turns green in interactive instructions, it indicates that your previous response was successfully saved. If you accidentally restart the task, you do not need to repeat it.

When you see the **“End”** button, click if:
- You want to end the current experimental session.

- You want to get up and start your day.
