When you realize you are dreaming, perform the **LRLR eye movement** (left-right-left-right) to mark the start of lucidity. 

The **LRLR eye movement** involves the following sequence:
1. **Left (L)**: Move your eyes to the left.
2. **Right (R)**: Move your eyes to the right.
3. **Left (L)**: Move your eyes to the left again.
4. **Right (R)**: Move your eyes to the right again.

Afterward, feel free to explore or observe the dream scene as you wish, without any further instructions.

If you experience any sensory cues, such as light, sound, or vibration, respond by repeating the **LRLR eye movement**. If no cues are detected, continue performing the **LRLR eye movement** approximately every **30 seconds** to maintain lucidity.
