You will need to wear the EEG headband throughout each session and ensure it is connected to the software.  

To establish the connection, you will need to connect the EEG headband receiver and turn on the EEG headband first before the real connection.

1. EEG headband receiver connection.

    - The EEG headband communicates with the software through the **EEG headband receiver** - a **dongle** included in your equipment set.  

    - **Plug the dongle into a USB port** on the laptop you were provided with.

2. Turn on the EEG headband.

    - There is a power button at the top of the EEG headband. Turn it on by sliding it.

    - The EEG headband has two types of LED lights:
   
        - A small LED light on the top left corner at the back that indicates the battery level.
   
        - Two large LED lights at the bottom side for light cueing.

    - You can tell if the EEG headband is on by looking at the **little LED light** and **listening to the sound**.

    - When the headband is **OFF**:

        - The little LED light blinks slowly in blue.

        - A single beep will sound when it is turned off.

    - When the headband is **ON**:

        - The little LED light is blue and will not blink.

        - Three quick beeps will sound.

    - If the light did not appear in a way described above, consult the **help menu** for more information on light indicators.
